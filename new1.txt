hello i am akhil nuthalapati
today i am here to share my thougths on space and time complexity the heartbeat of a algorithm
we always just dont try to run a code to work but we want it to be written in a way that it takes less t
ime and less amount of memory is consumed. thats where the space and time complexity steps in.
time complexity, we time complexiy is the measure ment of the increase in amount of time with the increa
se in user input for the programme executin. for example if the user input is doubled and the time take 
for execution is also doubled then it shows linear time complexity o(n). and if the user input is double
 d and the execution time becomes square of its previous method its a quadratic time complexity o(n^2).

on the other hand we have space complexity its mostly used to determine the extra amount of space requir
ed to run a programme. it also counts the variables, data structures, recursion stacks,etc...

so for the best practice a programmer must write a code in a faster and a way which consumes less memory
. its like tuning a car for both fuel and speed efficiency.

so i conclude that the space and time complexity isnt just theroy-- but a way to write an algorithm smar
tlt,efficiently and in a scalable manner.
